## how to install pip in chocolately

To install pip using Chocolatey, you need to have Chocolatey already installed on your system. If you haven't installed Chocolatey yet, you can follow these steps to install it:
Open a Command Prompt or PowerShell with administrative privileges.
Run the following command:

```bash
@"%SystemRoot%\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe" -NoProfile -InputFormat None -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command "iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))" && SET "PATH=%PATH%;%ALLUSERSPROFILE%\chocolatey\bin"
```

Once Chocolatey is installed, you can use the following command to install pip:

```bash
choco install python-pip
```

This will install pip and make it available in your PATH. You can then use pip to install other packages and libraries, such as the openai library.

## Could not build wheels for aiohttp, frozenlist, multidict, yarl, which is required to install pyproject.toml-based projects

The error message "Could not build wheels for aiohttp, frozenlist, multidict, yarl, which is required to install pyproject.toml-based projects" can occur when you try to install a Python package that has dependencies on these libraries.

The "wheels" are pre-built binary distributions of packages, which are faster to install than building packages from source. If the wheels are not available for a package's dependencies, pip may fail to install the package.

To resolve this issue, you can try the following steps:

Upgrade pip to the latest version by running the following command:

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
```

Install the required dependencies manually by running the following commands:

```bash
pip install aiohttp
pip install frozenlist
pip install multidict
pip install yarl
```

Try installing the package again after installing the dependencies.
If the error persists, try searching for the error message on Stack Overflow or the pip documentation for more information on how to resolve the issue.
